Introduction to Basic Operations in Data Science
In this task, you will be given a dataset (Titanic Survivers) and your job is to analyse the data given using relevant functions in Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib.

Tasks to Perform on this Dataset
A few things that I want you to do is -

 Download the dataset and load it using Pandas.
 Remove all the NULL values which are present in the dataset.
 Remove 'Name' and 'PassengerID' column
 Divide the dataset in 80:20 ratio using .loc and .iloc ONLY
 Plot a histogram for 'Fare','Age' column
 Plot bar chart for all binary columns (like 'Survived')
